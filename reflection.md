 One of the main challenges i faced during the setup was navigating directories using the cd commands. I often found my self in the wrong folder, which caused issues when trying to activate the virtual enrironment. I found it frustrating at first, especially when i could not figure out. i eventually  got to used it and perform it well. 

 Another issue i encountered was related to the placement of the manage.py file. I accidentally saved it inside the sub folder instead in the main folder. It caused error when trying to run django commands, as the system could not locate the manage.py. After realizing the mistake, i recreate the project and use the ./manage.py to save it in the main folder. This experience tought men the importance of being carefull and follow the instruction properly with the file paths and directory structure. As a result i became more confident using the terminal.
